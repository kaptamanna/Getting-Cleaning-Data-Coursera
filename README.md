<h1>Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment</h1>


<h3>Introduction:</h3>
This document explains work done by Tamanna Kapur, for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project provided by Coursera. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

<h3>Data:</h3>
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:   http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

<h3>Files:</h3>
The following files are attached as part of this project:

**README.md** = 
It is the current file which explains all the components of the project and their objectives.

**run_analysis.R** =  
R file that shows the entire process of getting and cleaning the data. It shows the steps for the following: 
<ol>
<li> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>

**CodeBook.md **=
The code book indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
